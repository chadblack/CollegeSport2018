In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue and discovered or destroyed, conquered
or civilized the Americas. Sixty years later, in 1552, López de Gómara, the
private secretary of Hernán Cortes, wrote, "The greatest event since the
creation of the world (excluding the incarnation and death of Him who created
it) is the discovery of the Indies \[i.e. Americas\]." He was, himself,
a participant the conquest of Mexico. From the very beginning, not only the
magnitude, but also the meaning of the Conquest of the Americas has been
a point of controversy and acclaim. The history of Early Latin America,
however, does not begin in October 1492. Indigenous bands and great
civilizations inhabited North and South America for more than ten thousand
years prior to the arrival of Europeans on the shores of Caribbean islands.
Thus, in this class we will concentrate on the pre-Colombian period, the
conquest period, and the ensuing three hundred years of Spanish (and to
a limited extent) Portuguese rule. The lectures will move both chronologically
and topically. We will concentrate on two key geographic areas of
examination--- central Mexico, home to the highly structured pre-Columbian
societies of the Maya and the Mexica, among many others, and later the center
of Spanish control in its northern kingdoms as the Viceroyalty of New Spain;
and, the central Andes, land of the Inca Empire and its subject polities (among
others), and home of the Viceroyalty of Peru, the center of Spanish power in
its southern kingdoms. Our class will cover a tremendous breadth of time and
territory, and as such the lectures, readings, and discussion sections are
designed to draw your critical attention to issues, including ethnicity,
gender, slavery, culture, and power, as well as the institutions and structures
that patterned native, African, and European experiences of Spanish and
Portuguese imperialism.

# policies


![](http://chadblack.net/511S2012/media/images/disability.png) Qualified
students with disabilities needing appropriate academic adjustments should
contact me as soon as possible to ensure that your needs are met in a timely
manner with appropriate documentation.

**Attendance:** Attendance at all class sessions is mandatory. If you will not be able to attend
class, please contact me ahead of time.

**Deadlines:** Assignments must be turned to the instructor no later than the
end of class on the day they are due, or at some other specified time
established by the professor. Late papers will not be accepted
for any reason without prior arrangement. This includes technology problems.

**Cell Phones and Laptops:** Please silence our cell phones prior to class.
Please do not text during class. Laptops are allowed only for tasks
related to this class. Distracting use of technology (social media,
surfing, etc.) causes problems not only for your own learning, but for
those around you. Research shows that analog notetaking improves learning.
Consider having paper with you. Based on the prevailing
literature, hand note-taking-- both while reading and in class-- leads to
substantially better educational outcomes. You are not required to have a laptop
in class, so feel free to leave it at home. If, however, you have reason to use
your laptop for notetaking, I won't stop you from doing so.

**Office Hours**: Students are strongly encouraged to speak with me outside of
class. The advantages of talking with me include: extra help on an assignment
or preparation for an exam; clarification of materials covered in lecture,
discussion of my comments on your work; discussion of this or related courses.
I am available during office hours on a first-come, first-served basis; if you
cannot come by during office hours, please contact me via email or phone and I
will be happy to set up an appointment with you.

**Changes:** I reserve the write to change this syllabus as the semester
progresses. This is not a contract, but rather a document to guide expectations
and clearly communicate weekly assignments. Please bring the syllabus with you
to our class meetings. Or, keep up with it on the course website.
