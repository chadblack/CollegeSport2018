The United States is unique in its blending of academia and "big time" athletics. Collegiate sport dates to the
middle of the nineteenth century, when it was seen to offer discipline and health to young men tempted by
leisure and illicit pastimes. Colleges established intercollegiate competition under the principles of
"Amateurism," principles that have been a cause of tension and scandal ever since. This course will trace the
history of collegiate sport and its relationships to both the University and the wider community. It examines the
evolution (and in some respects the remarkable consistency) of university priorities in the era of "big-time"
sports and considers the practical and moral implications of that evolution for both college athletes and the
institutions that claim to serve them. The course readings and assignments provide the historical grounding
needed to understand the conflicts at the heart of what the NCAA likes to call "the collegiate model of sport."
Are college sports "good" for athletes? Are modern universities meeting their obligations to the students they
recruit and admit? Given the historical trajectory of the big-time sport enterprise, is reform possible? If so, who
is responsible for fixing what ails college sports? What corrections should be applied and when? These are the
questions addressed in this course.

# policies


![](http://chadblack.net/511S2012/media/images/disability.png) Qualified
students with disabilities needing appropriate academic adjustments should
contact me as soon as possible to ensure that your needs are met in a timely
manner with appropriate documentation.

**Attendance:** Attendance at all class sessions is mandatory. If you will not be able to attend
class, please contact me ahead of time.

**Deadlines:** Assignments must be turned to the instructor no later than the
end of class on the day they are due, or at some other specified time
established by the professor. Late papers will not be accepted
for any reason without prior arrangement. This includes technology problems.

**Cell Phones and Laptops:** Please silence our cell phones prior to class.
Please do not text during class. Laptops are allowed only for tasks
related to this class. Distracting use of technology (social media,
surfing, etc.) causes problems not only for your own learning, but for
those around you. Research shows that analog notetaking improves learning.
Consider having paper with you. Based on the prevailing
literature, hand note-taking-- both while reading and in class-- leads to
substantially better educational outcomes. You are not required to have a laptop
in class, so feel free to leave it at home. If, however, you have reason to use
your laptop for notetaking, I won't stop you from doing so.

**Office Hours**: Students are strongly encouraged to speak with me outside of
class. The advantages of talking with me include: extra help on an assignment
or preparation for an exam; clarification of materials covered in lecture,
discussion of my comments on your work; discussion of this or related courses.
I am available during office hours on a first-come, first-served basis; if you
cannot come by during office hours, please contact me via email or phone and I
will be happy to set up an appointment with you.

**Changes:** I reserve the write to change this syllabus as the semester
progresses. This is not a contract, but rather a document to guide expectations
and clearly communicate weekly assignments. Please bring the syllabus with you
to our class meetings. Or, keep up with it on the course website.
