Over the course of the semester, we will be keeping track of college sport
scandals, and categorizing them to look for patterns. This summer, in
advance of our first day of class, the college sport world has offered up
a number of scandals to get us started.

1. [Representative Jim
   Jordan](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/jim-jordan-ohio-state-700578/),
   failing to prevent the routine sexual abuse of wrestlers by a team
   doctor at Ohio State University, where he was a coach in the 1990s.

2. [UNC-CH football coach Larry
   Fedora](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/07/18/unc-coach-larry-fedora-criticized-after-questioning-footballs-link-with-cte/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.0bbc2abb4f2d)
   made comments questioning the link between CTE and football. He also
   claimed that football was under attack in the US, and that the US would
   be weaker as a society without it.

3. [Thirteen UNC-CH
   athletes](https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2018/8/6/17597834/north-carolina-football-suspensions-players)
   were suspended for selling shoes issued to the team by Nike. The athletes received suspensions of between 2 and
   3 games. [UNC and
   Nike](https://www.newsobserver.com/sports/college/acc/unc/article198024869.html)
   have a contract that has been worth, at least \$35.68 million over the
   last decade. And Larry Fedora and Roy Williams have additional
   individual contracts with Nike for their teams to exclusively wear Nike
   apparel. 

4. [Reports of a toxic
   culture](https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/maryland-football-athletic-staffers-placed-on-leave-amid-report-of-harmful-culture/)
   at the University of Maryland following the death of Jordan McNair has
   put the Terrapin's coaching staff under scrutiny.
