5. <span style="color:red">UPDATE: [Urban
   Meyer](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/bigten/2018/08/22/ohio-state-suspends-urban-meyer-investigation/1018477002/)
   has been suspended for three games, and the rest of pre-season
   training, as a result of failing to report domestic abuse by one of his
   assistant coaches. Zach Smith was reported to the police (and even
   arrested) for domestic abuse nine times while coaching at OSU, but
   Meyer and the University's AD refused to act against him. Meyer then
   lied about this to the press this summer, forcing the Board of Trustees
   to take disciplinary action. The Board also released a [23-page
   report](https://www.landgrantholyland.com/2018/8/23/17757500/ohio-state-urban-meyer-report-independent-investigation-findings)
   on their investigation, and resulting suspension, which has been
   [critiqued
   already](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/brennan/2018/08/22/urban-meyer-remains-ohio-state-coach-loses-moral-high-ground-domestic-assault/1065039002/)
   by some in the press. On August 30th, [a member of The OSU Board of
   Trustees
   resigned](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/sports/ohio-state-trustee-resigns-urban-meyer.html) to protest the lenience of Urban Meyer's punishment
   following the Zach Smith revelations.


9. <span style="color:red">The NCAA announced today that it had
   dropped its [investigation into
   MSU](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/sports/ncaa-michigan-state-nassar.html)
   over Larry Nassar's abuse of gymnasts. According to the *New York
   Times*, the NCAA found that MSU had not violated any of its association
   rules, and thus the Nassar abuse scandal was not an NCAA scandal. This
   is the same logic the Association used to absolved UNC in its paper
   class scandal.</span>

7. Mississippi State University has [suspended
   Quarterback Nick
   Fitzgerald](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2792890-nick-fitzgerald-suspended-for-mississippi-states-opener-vs-stephen-f-austin)
   for the opening game against Stephen F. Austin. Fitzgerald's suspension
   is the result of a violation of team rules from March 2018.

8. Santino Marchio, a linebacker who transferred from Texas A&M to
   Arizona, has [alleged recruiting violations by Assitant Coach Bradley
   Dale
   Peveto](https://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2018/08/21/former-texas-am-linebacker-alleges-recruiting-practice-violations-by-jimbo-fishers-staff/).
   Marchio claims that Peveto provided him cash to entertain unofficial
   recruits on two weekends last Spring.


6. New allegations that the former [Athletic
   Director](http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/terps/tracking-the-terps/bs-sp-anderson-diamondback-lawyer-0823-story.html)
   of the University of Maryland hire an attorney with Athletic Department
   funds to represent two players accused of sexual assault. AD Kevin Anderson
   was told to stop by the school, but did not. Not and NCAA rules violation,
   but a problem for the University.

4. [Reports of a toxic
   culture](https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/maryland-football-athletic-staffers-placed-on-leave-amid-report-of-harmful-culture/)
   at the University of Maryland following the death of Jordan McNair has
   put the Terrapin's coaching staff under scrutiny.

3. [Thirteen UNC-CH
   athletes](https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2018/8/6/17597834/north-carolina-football-suspensions-players)
   were suspended for selling shoes issued to the team by Nike. The athletes received suspensions of between 2 and
   3 games. [UNC and
   Nike](https://www.newsobserver.com/sports/college/acc/unc/article198024869.html)
   have a contract that has been worth, at least \$35.68 million over the
   last decade. And Larry Fedora and Roy Williams have additional
   individual contracts with Nike for their teams to exclusively wear Nike
   apparel. 

2. [UNC-CH football coach Larry
   Fedora](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/07/18/unc-coach-larry-fedora-criticized-after-questioning-footballs-link-with-cte/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.0bbc2abb4f2d)
   made comments questioning the link between CTE and football. He also
   claimed that football was under attack in the US, and that the US would
   be weaker as a society without it.
