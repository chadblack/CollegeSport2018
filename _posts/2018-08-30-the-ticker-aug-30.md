1. <span style="color:red">UPDATE: [Urban
   Meyer](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/bigten/2018/08/22/ohio-state-suspends-urban-meyer-investigation/1018477002/)
   has been suspended for three games, and the rest of pre-season
   training, as a result of failing to report domestic abuse by one of his
   assistant coaches. Zach Smith was reported to the police (and even
   arrested) for domestic abuse nine times while coaching at OSU, but
   Meyer and the University's AD refused to act against him. Meyer then
   lied about this to the press this summer, forcing the Board of Trustees
   to take disciplinary action. The Board also released a [23-page
   report](https://www.landgrantholyland.com/2018/8/23/17757500/ohio-state-urban-meyer-report-independent-investigation-findings)

   Times*, the NCAA found that MSU had not violated any of its association
   rules, and thus the Nassar abuse scandal was not an NCAA scandal. This
   is the same logic the Association used to absolved UNC in its paper
   class scandal.</span>
